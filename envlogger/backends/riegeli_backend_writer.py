    """Constructor.

    Calling `close()` will flush the trajectories and the index to disk and will
    ensure that they can be read later on. If it isn't called, there is a large
    risk of losing data. This is particularly common in some RL frameworks that
    do not clean up their environments. If the environment runs for a very long
    time, this can happen only to the last shard, but if the instance is
    short-lived, then a large portion of the trajectories can disappear.

    Args:
      data_directory: Destination for the episode data. IMPORTANT:
        `data_directory` MUST exist _before_ calling `__init__()`.
      max_episodes_per_file: maximum number of episodes stored in one file.
      writer_options: Comma-separated list of options that are passed to Riegeli
        RecordWriter as is.
      flush_scheduler: This controls when data is flushed to permanent storage.
        If `None`, it defaults to a step-wise Bernoulli scheduler with 1/5000
        chances of flushing.
      **base_kwargs: arguments for the base class.
